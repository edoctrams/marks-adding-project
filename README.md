#  Marks Adder - Jupyter Notebook

A simple Python project that reads a CSV file containing student roll numbers and marks.  
If a roll number appears multiple times, the notebook adds up the marks and saves the final result in a new CSV file.

##  Features

- Aggregates marks for repeated roll numbers
- Outputs the total marks per student

##  How It Works

1. Load the input CSV file (`Mini Project - Marks Adding.csv`)
2. Group the data by `Roll Num`
3. Use `.sum()` to total the marks
4. Save the results using `.to_csv()`
